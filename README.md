# Sublime-text
#### C++ Build System:
Very helpful in competitive programming. This is for windows users only. I have used it on sublime-text 3 & 4 (should work on lower versions too).
After installing a c++ compiler (like MinGW) and setting up environment variables. Go to sublime-text->tools->build system->new build system, copy paste give a custom name as per your wish and save. Now again go to build system and select this custom one. After this, restart sublime once.

Lastly:
- set path accordingly and locate g++.exe in your drive (which might be different on your device).
- use c++ version as per installed compiler only.
- input.txt, output.txt should be in the same folder as cpp file.
- ctrl+shift+B => Enter => compiles the file.
- ctrl+shift+B => run to text => executes the latest compiled file using input.txt & output.txt files (so you dont need to give same input again & again).
- ctrl+shift+B => Run to cmd => opens a command prompt and executes the latest compiled file (for interactive problems).
